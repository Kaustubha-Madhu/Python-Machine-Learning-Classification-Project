# Python-Machine-Learning-Classification-Project
Bank Marketing Data - Python 
•   Identified a Classification Problem to predict the success of Bank Telemarketing by using the client’s term deposit subscription.  
•   Explored the dataset of 17 variables. Examined feature distribution, outliers, performed null values detection and correlation analysis. 
•   Utilized both supervised and unsupervised learning along with Cross validation, Grid search and Dimensionality Reduction. 
•   Modeled K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, Support Vector Machine (Linear and kernelized), Decision Tree.  
•   Executed Hard &amp; Soft Voting Classifiers, Bagging, pasting, ADA Boosting, Gradient Boosting using Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib packages. 
•   Achieved best Test score with Principle Component Analysis, preserving 95% of n_components using explained Variance in Scikit-learn.
